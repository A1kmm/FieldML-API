===========================================================

1. Make a symbolic link of the appropriate Makefile include
   file (or create your own).  There are examples of this
   file in the /MAKEFILES subdirectory.

      ln -s ./MAKEFILES/Makefile.inc.pwr6_xlf ./Makefile.inc

2. Use the appropriate make command.

      make all -> builds FieldML and FieldML-IO libraries
                  along with a test pHDF5 application.

The two main libraries will be built in the /LIBS sub-directory.
The test pHDF5 application binary will be placed in the /bin
sub-directory.
